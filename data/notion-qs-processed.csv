"Interstetitial Ad
I could implemented rewarded ads succesfully, however interstitials works on the editor not on devices","It sounds like you've successfully implemented rewarded ads but are encountering issues with interstitial ads working on devices. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Initialization**:
   Ensure that the Homa Belly SDK is properly initialized in your project. Initialization should be done before attempting to load or show any ads.

2. **Correct Method Usage**:
   Make sure you are using the correct method to show interstitial ads. Here is the basic code snippet to show an interstitial ad:
   ```csharp
   // Show interstitial
   HomaBelly.Instance.ShowInterstitial(""your_analytics_human_readable_ad_name"");
   ```

3. **Ad Availability**:
   Verify that the interstitial ad is available before attempting to show it. You can use the `IsInterstitialAvailable` method:
   ```csharp
   if (HomaBelly.Instance.IsInterstitialAvailable())
   {
       HomaBelly.Instance.ShowInterstitial(""your_analytics_human_readable_ad_name"");
   }
   else
   {
       // Handle the case where the ad is not available
   }
   ```

4. **Check for Errors**:
   Implement event listeners to catch any errors or issues during the ad loading and showing process. Here are some useful callbacks:
   ```csharp
   HomaGames.HomaBelly.Events.onInterstitialAdLoadFailedEvent += OnInterstitialAdLoadFailedEvent;
   HomaGames.HomaBelly.Events.onInterstitialAdShowFailedEvent += OnInterstitialAdShowFailedEvent;

   private void OnInterstitialAdLoadFailedEvent(AdInfo adInfo)
   {
       Debug.LogError(""Interstitial ad failed to load: "" + adInfo.PlacementId);
   }

   private void OnInterstitialAdShowFailedEvent(AdInfo adInfo)
   {
       Debug.LogError(""Interstitial ad failed to show: "" + adInfo.PlacementId);
   }
   ```

5. **Manifest Configuration**:
   Ensure that your Homa Belly manifest is correctly configured. Sometimes, issues on devices can be due to misconfigurations in the manifest.

6. **Network and Device Logs**:
   Check the device logs for any network-related issues or errors that might be preventing the ads from loading. Ensure that the device has a stable internet connection.

7. **Ad Network Integration**:
   Verify that all required ad network SDKs are correctly integrated and up-to-date. Sometimes, issues can arise from outdated or improperly integrated SDKs.

## Next Steps

If you've gone through these steps and the issue persists, it might be necessary to get more specific support. Here are your options:

- **Contact HomaGames Support**: Reach out to HomaGames support for more detailed assistance. They can help diagnose issues specific to your implementation.

Duplicate phoma sdk code when cleaning up the library folder I get these errors GUID [be4c2abe0582147efa9bc60bce57ef0c] for asset 'Packages/com.homagames.sdk-core/Analytics' conflicts with: 'Assets/Homa Games/Homa Belly/Core/Analytics' (current owner) We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.,"It looks like you're encountering a GUID conflict error due to duplicate assets in your project. This issue arises because the same asset exists in both the `Packages/com.homagames.sdk-core/Analytics` and `Assets/Homa Games/Homa Belly/Core/Analytics` folders. Since the asset in the `Packages` folder is immutable, Unity cannot assign a new GUID to resolve the conflict.

### Steps to Resolve the GUID Conflict

1. **Identify the Source of the Conflict:**
   - Determine which version of the asset you need to keep. Typically, the version in the `Packages` folder is the one managed by the SDK, while the one in the `Assets` folder might be a local copy.

2. **Remove the Duplicate Asset:**
   - If the asset in the `Assets` folder is not necessary, you can safely delete it to resolve the conflict.
   - Navigate to `Assets/Homa Games/Homa Belly/Core/Analytics` and delete the conflicting asset.

3. **Reimport the Project:**
   - After removing the duplicate asset, reimport your project to ensure that Unity updates its asset database.
   - Go to `Assets > Reimport All` in the Unity Editor.

### If the Issue Persists

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, or if you are unsure about which asset to keep, it is best to contact HomaGames support for further assistance. They can provide guidance specific to the Homa Belly SDK and help ensure that your project is set up correctly.

### Contact HomaGames Support

IAPs for iOS not fetched,"If your In-App Purchases (IAPs) for iOS are not being fetched, here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. Verify Homa Belly Manifest
Ensure that your Homa Belly manifest includes the `homabelly_purchases` package and that all product SKUs are properly configured. If you don't have this information, contact your publish manager.

### 2. Check the Catalog Configuration
Make sure the Catalog is correctly set up within your Unity project. You can modify the Catalog within the Unity Editor, and any changes will be preserved unless the **Restore to defaults** button is pressed.

### 3. Initialization
Ensure that you are initializing the HomaStore correctly at the beginning of your game. Here is a sample code snippet for initialization:

```csharp
public class PurchaseDemo : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        // Initialize
        HomaStore.OnProductsRetrieved += OnProductsRetrieved;
        HomaStore.Initialize();
    }

    private void OnProductsRetrieved(Product[] products)
    {
        // Here you will receive the complete list of products
        // fetched from the Store in case you want/need to iterate over
        // them. Use this to display items, price, etc...
    }
}
```

### 4. Error Handling
Check for common errors that might be causing the issue:

- **Error 2 - There was a problem with the store**: This error indicates a problem connecting with the store, which could be due to store servers being down or connection failures. If everything was working during testing, you might not need to handle this error in production.
- **Error 3 - The device or user is not allowed to make the purchase**: This error can occur if the credit card is not valid, has insufficient funds, or if the user is under parental control restrictions.

### 5. Manual Purchase Initiation
If you want to manually initiate a purchase, use the following code:

```csharp
public void InitiatePurchase(string productSku)
{
    HomaStore.PurchaseProduct(productSku);
}

private void OnPurchaseSuccessForProduct(Product product)
{
    // Product has been successfully purchased
}

private void OnPurchaseFailedWithError(Error error, Product product)
{
    // Purchase failed
}
```

### 6. Restoring Purchases
To manually trigger a purchase restore, use the following code:

```csharp
public void RestorePurchases()
{
    HomaStore.OnPurchasesRestored += OnPurchasesRestored;
    HomaStore.RestorePurchases();
}

private void OnPurchasesRestored(Product[] products)
{
    // The products list will contain all products (purchased and not purchased)
    // with their statuses updated.
}
```

"I'm getting this when trying to make a build of the game.

A problem occurred evaluating settings 'Gradle'.
> Could not find method dependencyResolutionManagement() for arguments [settings_7soecx61bn41hyzvwvg6dsm7x$_run_closure1@1670d069] on settings 'Gradle' of type org.gradle.initialization.DefaultSettings.","It looks like you're encountering an issue with your Gradle configuration. This error typically occurs when the `dependencyResolutionManagement` method is not recognized, which can happen if you're using an older version of Gradle that doesn't support this method.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check Gradle Version**
Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Gradle. The `dependencyResolutionManagement` method is available in Gradle 6.8 and later. You can check your Gradle version by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
gradle -v
```

### 2. **Update Gradle Wrapper**
If you're using an older version, you can update the Gradle wrapper to a newer version. Open your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file and update the `distributionUrl` to a newer version, for example:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-bin.zip
```

### 3. **Modify `settings.gradle`**
Ensure that your `settings.gradle` file is correctly configured. It should look something like this:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

### 4. **Sync Project with Gradle Files**
