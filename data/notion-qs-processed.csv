"After updating HB, Homa Games DataPrivacy Scene - has been removed from the build","It sounds like the DataPrivacy scene might not have been correctly integrated after the update. Here are a few steps to ensure it is properly included in your build:

1. **Check Homa Belly Core Version**:
   - Ensure you are using **Homa Belly Core v1.6.0** or later, as Data Privacy is embedded within the Core package starting from this version.

2. **Verify Scene Inclusion**:
   - Make sure the DataPrivacy scene is included in your build settings. Go to **File > Build Settings...** and check if the DataPrivacy scene is listed and enabled.

3. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - Homa Belly should automatically add the DataPrivacy scene as the first scene of the builds. Ensure that this scene remains the first scene in your build order.

4. **Manual Addition**:
   - If the scene is missing, you can manually add it back. Locate the DataPrivacy scene in your project and drag it into the build settings.

5. **Check Homa Belly Settings**:
   - Go to **Window > Homa Games > Homa Belly > Settings** and ensure that all relevant settings, especially those related to Data Privacy, are correctly configured.

If you continue to experience issues, you might want to consult the [Homa Belly Changelogs](https://support.homagames.com/changelogs/core) for any specific changes related to the DataPrivacy scene or contact [HomaGames support](https://www.notion.so/homagames/Contact-Us-d8933cf704834a2fbb5fc37b7702c069) for further assistance."
"Interstetitial Ad
I could implemented rewarded ads succesfully, however interstitials works on the editor not on devices","It sounds like you've successfully implemented rewarded ads but are facing issues with interstitial ads working on devices. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and ensure your interstitial ads work correctly on devices:

### **1. Verify Implementation**
Ensure that your implementation follows the correct method calls for interstitial ads. Here’s a quick reference:

```csharp
// Show interstitial
HomaBelly.Instance.ShowInterstitial(""your_analytics_human_readable_ad_name"");
```

### **2. Check Ad Availability**
Before attempting to show an interstitial ad, check if it is available:

```csharp
if (HomaBelly.Instance.IsInterstitialAvailable())
{
    HomaBelly.Instance.ShowInterstitial(""your_analytics_human_readable_ad_name"");
}
else
{
    Debug.Log(""Interstitial ad is not available."");
}
```

### **3. Event Callbacks**
Implement event callbacks to get more insights into what might be going wrong:

```csharp
HomaGames.HomaBelly.Events.onInterstitialAdLoadFailedEvent += OnInterstitialAdLoadFailedEvent;
HomaGames.HomaBelly.Events.onInterstitialAdShowFailedEvent += OnInterstitialAdShowFailedEvent;

private void OnInterstitialAdLoadFailedEvent(AdInfo adInfo)
{
    Debug.LogError(""Interstitial ad failed to load: "" + adInfo.PlacementId);
}

private void OnInterstitialAdShowFailedEvent(AdInfo adInfo)
{
    Debug.LogError(""Interstitial ad failed to show: "" + adInfo.PlacementId);
}
```

### **4. Network and Configuration**
- Ensure your device has a stable internet connection.
- Verify that your game is properly configured in Homa Lab to serve interstitial ads.
- Check if there are any specific ad network configurations or restrictions that might be affecting ad delivery on devices.

### **5. Testing on Devices**
- Make sure you are testing on a real device and not just the editor.
- Check for any device-specific issues or logs that might indicate why the ads are not showing.

### **6. Logs and Debugging**
- Use `Debug.Log` statements to log the flow of your ad loading and showing process.
- Check the device logs for any errors or warnings related to ad loading and displaying.

If you have followed these steps and the issue persists, it might be helpful to contact [HomaGames support](https://www.notion.so/homagames/Contact-Us-d8933cf704834a2fbb5fc37b7702c069) for further assistance.

Duplicate phoma sdk code when cleaning up the library folder I get these errors GUID [be4c2abe0582147efa9bc60bce57ef0c] for asset 'Packages/com.homagames.sdk-core/Analytics' conflicts with: 'Assets/Homa Games/Homa Belly/Core/Analytics' (current owner) We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.,"It looks like you're encountering a GUID conflict due to duplicate assets in your project. This typically happens when the same asset exists in multiple locations within your project. Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

### Steps to Resolve GUID Conflict

1. **Identify the Duplicate Assets:**
   - The error message indicates that the asset `Analytics` exists in both `Packages/com.homagames.sdk-core/Analytics` and `Assets/Homa Games/Homa Belly/Core/Analytics`.

2. **Remove the Duplicate:**
   - Decide which version of the asset you want to keep. Typically, you should keep the version in the `Packages` folder as it is managed by the package manager.
   - Delete the duplicate asset from the `Assets` folder:
     - Navigate to `Assets/Homa Games/Homa Belly/Core/Analytics`.
     - Delete the `Analytics` folder or file.

3. **Reimport the Project:**
   - After deleting the duplicate asset, reimport your project to ensure that Unity updates its asset database.
     - In Unity, go to `Assets` > `Reimport All`.

4. **Clear the Library Folder (Optional):**
   - If the issue persists, you can try clearing the Library folder:
     - Close Unity.
     - Navigate to your project directory and delete the `Library` folder.
     - Reopen Unity, which will regenerate the `Library` folder.

### Additional Tips

- **Backup Your Project:**
  - Before making any changes, ensure you have a backup of your project to prevent any data loss.

- **Check for Other Duplicates:**
  - Ensure there are no other duplicate assets in your project that might cause similar issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the GUID conflict and clean up your project. If you continue to experience issues, please contact [HomaGames support](https://www.notion.so/homagames/Contact-Us-d8933cf704834a2fbb5fc37b7702c069) for further assistance."
IAPs for iOS not fetched,"If your In-App Purchases (IAPs) for iOS are not being fetched, here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### **1. Verify Product Configuration**
- Ensure that your Homa Belly manifest includes the `homabelly_purchases` package.
- Check that all product SKUs are properly configured in the Catalog within your Unity project.

### **2. Initialization**
- Make sure you are initializing the Homa Store correctly at the start of your game. Here is a sample code snippet for initialization:

```csharp
public class PurchaseDemo : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        // Initialize
        HomaStore.OnProductsRetrieved += OnProductsRetrieved;
        HomaStore.Initialize();
    }

    private void OnProductsRetrieved(Product[] products)
    {
        // Here you will receive the complete list of products
        // fetched from the Store in case you want/need to iterate over
        // them. Use this to display items, price, etc...
    }
}
```

### **3. Check for Errors**
- Look for any error messages in your logs that might indicate why the products are not being fetched. Common errors include connectivity issues or misconfigured product IDs.

### **4. Restore Catalog**
- If the Catalog was wrongly configured, you can restore it to defaults. This will clean up any modifications and configure it from scratch with the remotely configured values.

### **5. Dynamic Products**
- If you need to fetch products that are not present in the Homa Belly Purchases Catalog, you can use the `HomaStore.AddDynamicProductsToCatalog` method. Here is an example:

```csharp
public void FetchNewProducts()
{
    HomaStore.AddDynamicProductsToCatalog(
#if UNITY_ANDROID
        new ProductSimpleDefinition(""com.example.iap.test.subscription"", ProductType.SUBSCRIPTION),
        new ProductSimpleDefinition(""com.example.iap.test.consumable"", ProductType.CONSUMABLE),
        new ProductSimpleDefinition(""com.example.iap.test.nonconsumable"", ProductType.NON_CONSUMABLE)
#elif UNITY_IOS
        new ProductSimpleDefinition(""com.example.iap.test.subscription"", ProductType.SUBSCRIPTION),
        new ProductSimpleDefinition(""com.example.iap.test.consumable"", ProductType.CONSUMABLE),
        new ProductSimpleDefinition(""com.example.iap.test.nonconsumable"", ProductType.NON_CONSUMABLE)
#endif
    );
}
```

### **6. RevenueCat Integration**
- If you are using RevenueCat, ensure that your products are correctly set up in the RevenueCat dashboard. You can refer to RevenueCat's [troubleshooting guide](https://community.revenuecat.com/sdks-51/why-are-offerings-or-products-empty-124) for more details.

### **7. Contact Support**
- If the issue persists, it might be best to contact [HomaGames support](https://www.notion.so/homagames/Contact-Us-d8933cf704834a2fbb5fc37b7702c069) for further assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with your iOS IAPs not being fetched. If you need more detailed guidance, feel free to ask!"
